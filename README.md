# LIBFT

## The libft project is a common introduction to the C programming language in the 42 school curriculum.
The goal of libft is to create a custom C library from scratch, reimplementing essential standard C library functions,
as well as a few additional utility functions connected with lists in C.

> Tips for Success
Understand the function prototypes: Study the behavior of each function from the C Standard Library (man pages are helpful).
Write clean, modular code: Split complex tasks into helper functions.
Test thoroughly: Check edge cases like empty strings, null pointers, and extreme inputs.
Use error handling: Ensure your functions gracefully handle invalid inputs where applicable.
Stick to 42 Norms: Follow coding standards required by the 42 School.
